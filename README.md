# Edited Guidelines From Israel's Home Front Command (Pikud HaOred)

*Update: 08-08-24*

I created this repository as a preparedness resource at a time of volitility in the Middle East. 

There are two distinct purposes:

- To improve upon the English translation of the official rocket preparedness instructions
- To rewrite the preparedness instructions for logical clarity to support programmatic use or the devising of decision tree algorithms (etc)

## Important Notes

The official rocket preparedness guidelines issued by Pikud Haoref - like all emergency preparedness guidelines issued by governement bodies - are subject to revision and change as the scientifiic corpus they are based upon improves and evolves. 

This repository is a snapshot in time reflection of them created as a public resource during this specific period.

## Use Case Statement

Preparedness / clarification of emergency procedures.

## Legal Notice

No legal warranty offered as to the accuracy of the information.

Do not rely upon this decision making tree for your own preparedness.
